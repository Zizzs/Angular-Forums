# _Forum Template_

#### A forum template that uses angular to speed up the ability to read/write forum posts.

#### By _**Alex Williams**_

## Specs and Features
    1. The user must be able to enter the website and have a clear understanding of where to navigate to find a forum they want to view.

    2. The user should be able to either create an account and keep all post history on their account, or be able to post anonymously without post saving.

    3. The user must be able to read, preview, and edit all comments commited to forum posts. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
